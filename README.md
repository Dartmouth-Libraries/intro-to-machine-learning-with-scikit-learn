# Intro to Machine Learning with scikit-learn

An introduction into Machine Learning using the popular Python toolkit scikit-learn. This material was created for a Reproducible Research workshop offered at Dartmouth College. While it is best used as part of a code-along session, it can also be consumed as a stand-alone tutorial.

## Session description
Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn) is a machine learning library written in Python. It features models and methods for supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, model selection and evaluation, and even some techniques for the visualization of results. Because of its efficient implementations and accessible interface, scikit-learn is very popular in educational, research, and production environments, and runs “under the hood” of many other, more streamlined libraries (e.g. NLTK, auto-sklearn, or PyCaret).

In this code-along workshop, we will introduce various components of scikit-learn. By the end of the session, you will be able to implement a typical machine learning workflow.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Basic Python programming skills are required to do the code-along.
- A good grasp of the fundamentals of machine learning will help you get the most out of this course.

### Install
The material is provided as Jupyter notebooks. To run them, you need some kind of Jupyter server. Some options are:
- A [local Jupyter installation](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- The [Dartmouth JupyterHub](https://jhub.dartmouth.edu/) (Dartmouth-only)

### Usage
The repo contains two notebooks:
- `Intro-to-Ml-with-sklearn.ipynb`
  - This notebook is intended to be used in a code-along session. It contains instructions and background info and has a number of empty code cells for you to fill in.
- `Intro-to-Ml-with-sklearn_completed.ipynb`
  - This notebook is a copy of the above version but with all code cells filled in. You can use this as a reference should you get stuck.
